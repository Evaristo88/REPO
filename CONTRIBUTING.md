# Contributing

Thanks for your interest in contributing to this lab repository. A few suggestions:

- Create a feature branch: `git checkout -b feature/your-change`
- Add tests for any new behavior and run `./run_tests.sh`.
- Keep changes small and focused; add documentation to `LAB_DOCUMENTATION.md` and `README.md`.
- Open a pull request against `main` and include a short description of the change.

For significant changes (auto-blocking logic, firewall integration, or parsing
improvements), please include a security review and test on a safe environment
before enabling on production hosts.
